If the mongodb database is stored in an encrypted filesystem, then
mongodb can not be started with the upstart scripts.

Modify /etc/init/mongodb.conf by commenting out "start on runlevel ...".
However, leave the "stop on runlevel ..." line so that the database is shut
down gracefully during system shutdown, reducing the likelihood of database
corruption.

Monit can be used to monitor the query-gateway software, which depends
on mongodb, but monitoring must be started manually after the mongodb
service starts with:

  sudo monit start query-gateway

Since the monitoring state is persistent across Monit restarts, during
system shutdown the query-gateway needs to be set to unmonitored.  This
can be done by adding the following line into the stop section of
/etc/init.d/monit:

  /usr/bin/monit unmonitor query-gateway
